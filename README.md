The Hong Kong Polytechnic University MSc thesis latex template. (for Department of Computing)

When I started writing my thesis in April 2012, I wished that there would be some existing template that fulfil the MSc thesis format requirements. I searched for a while but the result was disappointing.

To get started quickly, I used puthesis found at [https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/puthesis/](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/puthesis/). Then I modified the template for everything I found different from the Word template on the department website.

Here is a sample thesis. As the author of puthesis did not explicitly mention any licensing issue, I would say that you can do anything you want on this template.

I wrote [a blog post](http://qingpei.me/posts/latex-typesetting/) on some of my modifications. You are welcome to take a look  at that.

The department website says the digital submission, i.e. the pdf file, should have "fast web view" enabled. I used a tool called "qpdf" to do this. The command I used can be found in "convpdf.sh" included in this project.
