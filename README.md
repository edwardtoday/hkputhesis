The Hong Kong Polytechnic University MSc thesis latex template. (for Department of Computing)

When I started writing my thesis in April 2012, I wished that there would be some existing template that fulfil the MSc thesis format requirements. I searched for a while but the result was disappointing.

To get started quickly, I used puthesis found at [https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/puthesis/](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~mark/puthesis/). Then I modified the template for everything I found different from the Word template on the department website.

Here is a sample thesis. As the author of puthesis did not explicitly mention any licensing issue, I would say that you can do anything you want on this template.
